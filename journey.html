                <h3>From Physician to Historian</h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I am Luke, a physician by training, a gentile who became a follower of The Way. Though I never walked with Jesus during his earthly ministry, I was compelled to create an orderly account of his life and teachings after speaking with those who witnessed his work firsthand.</p>
                    
                    <p>My training as a physician taught me to observe carefully, to understand people's conditions by listening attentively to their accounts. This same careful attention to detail served me well as I collected the stories of Jesus's life and ministry.</p>
                    
                    <p>As I traveled with Paul, I encountered many of those who had walked with Jesus—disciples, women who supported his ministry, those who had been healed, and others whose lives were transformed by his teachings. Their testimonies painted a picture of a leader unlike any other.</p>

            <div class="journal-entry">
                <h3>The Eyewitness Accounts</h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>What struck me most was how Jesus formed a team that would carry his mission forward. Many leaders seek power and glory for themselves, but Jesus built a community that would outlast his physical presence.</p>
                    
                    <p>I spent time with Peter, who told me of his failures and how Jesus never gave up on him. I listened to Mary's account of the annunciation and the early days. I heard from ordinary people whose lives were changed through healing and teaching.</p>
                    
                    <p>The women who funded Jesus's ministry shared how he treated them with dignity and respect, giving them roles that would have been unthinkable in our society. Tax collectors and sinners spoke of how he ate with them when religious leaders shunned them.</p>
                    
                    <p>From these varied accounts, I began to recognize patterns in how Jesus selected, trained, and empowered his followers—patterns that would reshape human history.</p>

                <h3>Why I Wrote This Account</h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Many had already undertaken to compile accounts of Jesus's life. Some focused on his teachings, others on his lineage or his miracles. But as I listened to the stories of how the disciples were transformed, I saw something unique—a model of leadership that could change the world.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wrote to Theophilus, but my account was intended for people of all backgrounds who seek truth. I wanted readers to understand not just what Jesus taught but how he built a movement that would spread across the Roman Empire and beyond.</p>
                    
                    <p>Though I was not an eyewitness to Jesus's ministry, I had a front-row seat to see how his leadership philosophy continued to transform lives even after his ascension. I witnessed the explosive growth of a movement birthed by a small team that Jesus had carefully selected and prepared.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my account, I wanted to show how Jesus's approach to leadership differed from both the Roman authorities and the religious leaders of his day. He led through service rather than domination, through empowerment rather than control.</p>

            <div class="testimony-box">
                <h3>My Personal Transformation</h3>
                <p>Although I never met Jesus in person, his impact on those who did was undeniable. The disciples who once argued over position now served selflessly. The women who were marginalized in society became bold witnesses. The despised tax collectors became generous stewards.</p>
                <p>Seeing this transformation in others changed me as well. As a physician, I had sought to heal bodies. Now I understood that true healing must address the whole person—body, mind, and spirit. Jesus's model of leadership showed me that transformation happens in community, through relationships built on love and mutual respect.</p>
