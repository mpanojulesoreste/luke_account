                <p>This creative project explores the transformative leadership of Jesus through the perspective of Luke, a physician and historian who documented the early Christian movement. By examining the Gospel of Luke and other early Christian texts, this project aims to illuminate the leadership principles that transformed ordinary people into world-changers.</p>

                <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>This project was created for REL/CLA/HLS 252 Spring 2025; which explores who Jesus of Nazareth was and how we know about him, why certain interpretations of his message won over others, and how the small, illicit Christian movement grew to reshape the social, political, sexual, and religious landscape of the Roman Empire and cultures worldwide.</p>
                    
                    <p>The assignment prompt was to "Chose a moment or topic that grabbed your attention and tell that story from the perspective of a minor character (so not Jesus or Paul, for example)." Since, we were particularly fascinated by the expansion of Christianity and what we can learn from Jesus's team (the disciples) as a model of transformative leadership, we choose Luke as the narrator to examine leadership principles from the perspective of someone who carefully investigated and documented the early Christian movement without being one of the original disciples. Luke's position as both an insider and an observer makes him an ideal lens through which we explored how Jesus built and developed his team.</p>
                    
                    <p>The leadership principles highlighted in this project reflect both ancient wisdom and timeless truths about how transformative leaders create lasting change through vision, example, selection, training, correction, and recognition. These principles remain relevant for anyone seeking to lead positive change in any context.</p>

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>This project draws primarily on the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles, examining them through the lens of transformative leadership. The narrative has been constructed based on our understanding of early Christianity and reasonable inferences about Luke's perspective as the author.</p>
                    
                    <p>While maintaining historical accuracy regarding the first-century context, we have taken a creative approach in developing Luke's voice and his reflections on the leadership principles he observed. The leadership framework used to analyze Jesus's approach is drawn from both the biblical texts and contemporary leadership theory.</p>
                    
                    <p>The six leadership principles highlighted in this project emerge from patterns visible in Luke's gospel: Jesus's clear articulation of mission (Luke 4:18-19), his embodiment of the values he taught, his careful selection of team members (Luke 6:12-13), his investment in training them, his correction of problematic behaviors, and his recognition of their achievements and potential.</p>

                <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>We would like to express our gratitude to the instructors and fellow students of REL/CLA/HLS 252 for the insightful discussions and readings that inspired this project. The course materials and class discussions have deepened my understanding of early Christianity and provided the foundation for this creative exploration of transformative leadership through the lens of Luke.</p>
                    
                    <p>This project focuses specifically on the aspects of Jesus's leadership that resonated most strongly with us: his clear vision and mission, his embodiment of the values he taught, his careful selection of team members, his investment in training, his correction of problematic behaviors, and his recognition of achievements and potential.</p>
                    
                    <p>By examining these principles through Luke's perspective, We hope to offer a fresh view of how the early Christian movement spread so effectively across the Roman Empire and beyond—not through political power or military might, but through a radical model of servant leadership that empowered ordinary people to become agents of transformation.</p>
